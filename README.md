This project aims to propose a solution for an automatic puzzle solving algorithm. 
We, a group of three students, carried out this project in an academic purpose. It is a preliminary work that could be the basis for further work.

[![Linter Actions Status](https://github.com/Seon82/puzzle_solver/actions/workflows/lint.yml//badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Seon82/puzzle_solver/actions)

A computer vision application to solve puzzles.


## Installation
This package requires `python>=3.10`.

* Clone the repository.
* Run `pip install .` from the root of the project to install the package and its dependencies.


## Examples 
Some examples on how to use the code are given in the two notebooks. 
You can find the fully working code of the puzzle automated solver in `examples/tile_detection.ipynb`. The code is applied on a twelve-piece puzzle example and you can see every step of the resolution. 
In the `examples/polar_coordonates.ipynb` notebook, you can find some details about the polar coordonate corners detection method that we implemented, but did not end up using for reasons detailed in our report.
